## Abstract 

The capacitated centered clustering problem (CCCP) involves partitioning a set of $n$ points on $R^d$ ($d\ge2$) into $p$ disjoint clusters within a given capacity. Each point has an associated demand, and the objective is to minimize the sum of the Euclidean distances between the points and their respective cluster centroids. This challenge has garnered the interest of researchers from diverse fields because of its applicability and theoretical aspects. In this study, we propose effective methodologies for the construction and diversification of solutions—multi-start clustering packing and an effective neighborhood search movement-wave. These strategies were carefully designed for classical tabu search and path-relinking metaheuristics to solve CCCP cases. We demonstrate that the proposed method is experimentally robust, and is more effective than the most recently published methods based on cluster search, biased random key genetic algorithm, and Gnägia and Baumann matheuristic.
